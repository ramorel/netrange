# Network Range

Network range is a node-level measure of the diveristy of the composition of ego networks. It is based on Burt (1981) and implemented by Reagans & McEvily (2003). The measure is useful for determining the diversity of information actors in a social network have access to.

The vignette has more detail, but the measurement captures two things: one, how broadly an actor spreads her ties across distinct subgroups in a network; and two, how cohesive those district subgroups are. The key idea is that an ego network is more diverse if an actor spreads her ties widely and is connected to subgroups that are less cohesive.
